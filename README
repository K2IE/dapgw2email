This python3 program is meant to be run on a working Pi-Star system.  It will
monitor incoming DAP GW traffic for messages send to a specified RIC.  When
detected, it will trigger an email with the contents of the pager message.

This is a great way to play with POCSAG paging for amateur radio without
having to first invest in a pager.

Thanks to the DAPNET (Decentralized Amateur Paging Network) folks for provining
the backend that makes all this work.  Thanks to G4KLX for providing the
gateway software and to MW0MWZ for including it in his Pi-Star distribution.

The configuration needs to be done in /etc/default/dapgw2email file.

A systemd unit service file is included.  Look also at the line added to
/etc/cron.daily/pistar-daily file to restart dapgw2email daily after Pi-Star
does its daily updates.

This software is offered under the terms of the Gnu General Public License
v3.0.
