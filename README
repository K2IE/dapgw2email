This python3 program is meant to be run on a working Pi-Star system.  It will
monitor incoming DAP GW traffic for messages sent to a specified RIC.  When
detected, it will trigger an email with the contents of the pager message.

This is a great way to play with POCSAG paging for amateur radio without
having to first invest in a pager.

Thanks to the DAPNET (Decentralized Amateur Paging Network) folks for providing
the backend that makes all this work.  Thanks to G4KLX for providing the
gateway software and to MW0MWZ for including it in his Pi-Star distribution.

For more information about amateur radio paging, see https://hampager.de.

Configuration needs to be done in the /etc/default/dapgw2email file.

A systemd unit service file is included.  Look also at the line added to
/etc/cron.daily/pistar-daily script to restart dapgw2email daily after Pi-Star
does its daily updates.
